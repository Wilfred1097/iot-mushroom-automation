The IoT Mushroom Automation System is an ESP32-based smart farming solution designed to automate and optimize mushroom cultivation. It integrates sensors, actuators, and Wi-Fi connectivity to monitor and control environmental conditions remotely and automatically.

Key Features:

1. Automation for Mushroom Farming:
Automates key aspects of mushroom cultivation, such as temperature, humidity, and light regulation.

2. Remote Monitoring and Control:
Uses Wi-Fi connectivity to enable farmers to monitor and manage the system remotely.

3. Sensor Integration:
Employs various sensors to collect real-time data on environmental conditions.

4. Actuator Control:
Controls actuators to adjust environmental parameters automatically based on sensor data.

5. ESP32-Based System:
Built on the ESP32 microcontroller, known for its low power consumption and robust wireless capabilities.

Communication Process:

1. Wi-Fi Connection Setup:
The ESP32 connects to the local Wi-Fi network to establish internet connectivity.
If the connection is lost, the system attempts automatic reconnection by reinitializing the Wi-Fi parameters.

2. Cloud Synchronization:
The ESP32 sends sensor readings and device statuses (e.g., temperature, humidity, misting state) to a cloud-based API endpoint.
Data is sent using HTTP POST requests in JSON format.

3. Data Serialization:
Sensor data (e.g., temperature and humidity) is serialized into a JSON structure using libraries like ArduinoJson.

4. HTTP Communication:
The ESP32 uses the HTTPClient library to handle HTTP requests.
A POST request is sent to the cloud API with the serialized JSON data as the payload.

5. Response Handling:
The ESP32 checks the HTTP response code to confirm successful data transmission (HTTP 200).
If the transmission fails, it retries the operation multiple times.

6. Custom API Integration:
If internet connectivity is available, the ESP32 also connects to the custom api for additional remote control and monitoring.
In the absence of connectivity, the system switches to offline mode and continues to operate autonomously.

Security Measures:

1. Wi-Fi Security:
Implements secure Wi-Fi connections to protect the system from unauthorized access.

2. Input Validation and Sanitization:
Ensures all data inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.

3. Dependency Management:
Uses updated and verified dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities from outdated libraries.

4. Best Practices for IoT Security:
Likely includes mechanisms such as secure boot and firmware validation to prevent tampering.

Key Highlights:

1. Secure Communication:
The use of HTTPS ensures encrypted communication between the ESP32 and the cloud server.
2. Resilience:
Multiple retry attempts are implemented for both Wi-Fi reconnections and cloud synchronization.
3. Autonomous Mode:
In case of connectivity loss, the system continues to operate locally, ensuring uninterrupted functionality.
This comprehensive system demonstrates an efficient and secure approach to modern, automated mushroom farming. It combines IoT technologies with best practices in communication and security to deliver a reliable solution for farmers.
